* Description
This layer adds support for the [[https://proofgeneral.github.io/][Proof General]]
interface to the [[https://coq.inria.fr/][Coq Proof Assistant]].

** Features
- Loads the [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq][company-coq]] extension

* Install
** Layer
To use this configuration layer,
clone this repository into =~/emacs.d/private/=.
You will need to add =coq= as one of the
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=
in your =~/.spacemacs= file.

** Dependencies
- Coq (of course)
- Proof general

** Troubleshooting

Specify the path to Proof General by modifying the
=config.el= file shipped as part of this layer if
you see this error:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  File error: Cannot open load file,
  No such file or directory,
  /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/proof-general/generic/proof-site
#+END_SRC

In case you experience unwanted auto-completion
when leaving Evil insert mode, put this line into
your =dotspacemacs/user-init=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-want-abbrev-expand-on-insert-exit nil)
#+END_SRC
